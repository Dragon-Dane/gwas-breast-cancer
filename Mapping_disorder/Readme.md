# Mapping-disorder

Map SNPs to order and disorder database

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) led to different functions in many of the eukaryotic proteins.
Mapping SNPs to disordered region is an important feature for different SNPs to check their role in diseases progression.
Disopred3 is a new prediction tool to predict regions of disorder in proteins.
Here, we introduce a script to map disorder prediction of proteins using Disopred.


The command will be = 'python mapping_disorder.py -input SNPs_file -out output'
